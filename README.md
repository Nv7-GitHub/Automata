# Automata
A collection of cellular Automata, using Raylib and written in Go!

Use `gputemplate` for a cellular automata template using the GPU, and `cputemplate` for a cellular automata template using the CPU!

## CPU vs GPU
`gputemplate` is preferred, but `cputemplate` is easier to code for and its extremely difficult to use the GPU for more complicated automata.

`empires` is made using the CPU template due to the complicated rules and datastructures, but `wireworld` was made using the GPU.
